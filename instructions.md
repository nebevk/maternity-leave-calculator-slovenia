🍼 Parental Leave in Slovenia (2024–2025)
📌 Overview
This report covers maternity, paternity, and parental leave in Slovenia, including the latest legal updates and the differences for employed, self-employed, and unemployed parents. It also outlines the rules for calculating the start and end dates of each type of leave.

👩‍🍼 Maternity Leave
Duration: 105 calendar days.

Start: 28 days before the expected due date, as determined by a gynecologist.

End: 77 days after the due date (or 105 days after birth if the leave starts on the birth date).

Maternity leave must be used continuously and cannot be split.

If the baby is born before maternity leave starts, it begins automatically on the day of birth.

At least 15 days must be used by the mother—this part is mandatory.

📅 Rules for Calculating Maternity Leave Dates
Input:
Expected due date (EDD), as confirmed by a doctor.

Rules:
Start date = EDD – 28 calendar days

End date = Start date + 105 days
OR = Birth date + 105 days, if birth occurs earlier than the planned start

Example:
EDD: July 15, 2025

Start: June 17, 2025

End: September 30, 2025

Notes:
If the child is born earlier than June 17, leave starts on the birth date and still lasts 105 days.

This rule ensures the total leave duration remains 105 days.
